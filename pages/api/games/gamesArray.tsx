The Amuni event features a new series of quests that revolve around members of an ancient culture. The titular Amuni, from the Unur continent, have suffered a calamity. As they were building a new settlement, the land they were building on turned out to be too unstable. The end result was that the city and most of its inhabitants were buried beneath the land.</p>\r\n<p>One scout did manage to escape, however, and made their way to Elvenar to seek help. Now, players are tasked with uncovering the buried settlement and its people. Doing so will also reveal information about the Amuni‚Äôs history and their powerful feline god queen ‚Äì who is no longer around to see to her people.</p>\r\n<p>During the event, players will need to search the outskirts of their city to find provisions that can be traded for shovels, bottled winds, and vacuum vials ‚Äì all tools necessary to uncover the buried city. Shovels can be used to clear a patch of dirt at a time while bottled wind will clear an entire column. The vacuum vial clears dirt on all patches around it. Uncover daily rewards and Amuni Knowledge. The latter is used to purchase new artifacts and upgrade the Echoes of Forgotten.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9aecGbTgWMI" title="YouTube video player" width="709" height="418" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>',

It looks like those efforts were successful, as the Fallen Earth Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/FallenEarth/status/1495830764449337345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced yesterday</a> that it had "re-enabled Fallen Earth on Steam for players to download."</p>\r\n<p>That said, the game has sported a <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/113420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steady audience of double- to low-triple-digit players</a> since that October announcement, so we\'re not entirely sure just how much has changed over the past 24 hours. Still, if you want to check the game out, it\'s now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/113420/Fallen_Earth_Classic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially re-launched on Steam</a>.</p>\r\n<p>More surprising than Fallen Earth\'s revival is the return of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/17020/Global_Agenda_Free_Agent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Agenda on Steam.</a> It was the first online multiplayer game from Hi-Rez Studios -- which, yes, did make games before Smite. Judging by <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/17020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its player count</a>, it\'s been on Steam since late January, though Hi-Rez has made no effort to publicize its resurrection; the game is even unlisted, so it won\'t show up in search results.</p>\r\n<p>Originally launched as a paid game with a subscription in February 2010, Global Agenda went F2P all the way <a href="../news/global-agenda-goes-free-to-play" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in April 2011</a>, branding itself as Global Agenda: Free Agent. It struggled to find an audience, with Hi-Rez CEO Erez Goren <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1m7ybi/what_will_hirez_do_with_smite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying on Reddit</a> that the game "lost a lot of money" and that "no matter how much work we did the user base kept declining." It and Tribes: Ascend cost Hi-Rez $40 million in development costs, while delivering only $10 million in revenue. Servers were shut down in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>A sequel, Global Agenda 2, <a href="../news/hi-rez-studios-announces-global-agenda-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was announced</a> but faded into nothingness over half a decade ago. It\'s unlikely to ever be revived, but maybe GA\'s clandestine return to Steam is a sign that Hi-Rez hasn\'t totally given up on the franchise. The first game came out at a bad time, when "post-apocalyptic shooter MMO" wasn\'t anyone\'s cup of tea and subscription-based games were just starting their decline, but maybe a 2020s version of the game, in some format, could be successful.</p>',

He said that he looked forward to "continued collaboration" with the Inflexion team, which would seem to indicate that Nightingale isn\'t going to be switching from the Improbable Engine.</p>\r\n<p>An early access launch for Nightingale on PC is still scheduled for later this year, Flynn said.

Bethesda Softworks <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/2RXxG1y000NWupPalzLblG/sunsetting-the-bethesda-net-launcher-and-migrating-to-steam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced today</a> that it will be closing the Bethesda Launcher and migrating its functionality to Steam, bringing games like The Elder Scrolls Online, Fallout 76, and more to their permanent home on Steam.</p>\r\n<p>The first thing the developer wants you to know is the migration "will include your game library and Wallet ‚Äì meaning you will not lose anything from your Bethesda.net account." Your purchases via the Bethesda Launcher -- including cash shop currency for Bethesda\'s MMOs -- will transfer, though some save files will require a manual transfer. Bethesda will make available detailed instructions on exactly what you need to do in early April, and at some point in May, you will no longer be able to launch games via the Bethesda Launcher.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the FAQ on the page announcing the transfer, there\'s a separate, <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/FfWIVEmUL8vXXpAtkYnCT/farewell-bethesda-net-launcher-fallout-76-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fallout 76-specific FAQ</a> that mostly boils down to "All your progress and currency will be maintained." One significant item is that, if you have a Fallout 1st membership, you\'ll receive all the Atoms you would have normally received for the remainder of your membership all at once and your subscription will not automatically renew.</p>\r\n<p>So why is Bethesda taking this step? Its games have been on Steam for a long time, but it\'s one of the few companies (along with Blizzard and Ubisoft, to name a couple) that would seem to be big enough to maintain its own launcher and see significant income without having to pay a cut to Valve. Maybe there\'s not as much business going through the Bethesda Launcher as we thought -- or perhaps its new(-ish) owner, Microsoft, is calling for this change, for reasons that are as yet unclear.</p>',

Today, Bethesda released <a title="Fallout 76 2022 Roadmap" href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game‚Äôs latest roadmap</a> for player perusal and it seems like there\'s a good bit to look forward to soon. If nothing else, there‚Äôs something for every season. The roadmap details content for Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter including new public events, missions, and even a traveling roadshow. Sounds like‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not sure if ‚Äúgood time‚Äù is the best way to describe the post-apocalyptic world, but it should definitely be interesting.</p>\r\n<p>Beginning in the spring, players can expect alien visitors in Invaders From Beyond. Take part in new public events and random encounters, all centered on stopping the alien threat. Spring will also bring a Fallout Worlds update that allows players to earn SCORE and the release of Season 8: A Better Life Underground.</p>\r\n<p>In the summer update, players will be asked to ready up for battle and fight automatons in "Test Your Metal". The summer update will also improve the Fallout 1st scoreboard and introduce a new season.</p>\r\n<p>Fall will send players to The Pitt, a post-nuclear Pittsburgh, where they will need to take on a new mission, meet new characters ‚Äì some of which they will fight. The Pitt will also introduce another Season.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, Winter will arrive not only with snow but with the Nuka World on Tour. This is a traveling roadshow. They haven‚Äôt stated exactly what attractions the roadshow might have, but it does come with yet another Season, public events, and a new boss.</p>\r\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large" src="../file/2022/2/fallout-76-2022-roadmap-709x418.jpg" alt="Fallout 76 2022 Roadmap" width="709" height="418" /></p>',

There are 117 objectives in all to complete, with one reward given upon purchase and the other seven handed out approximately every 17 achievements. The pass will expire after the current league ends and its rewards will not be available after that.</p>\r\n<p>Responses to the Kirac\'s Vault pass from fans has been almost universally negative, and it\'s not hard to see why. The skins are only usable for a select group of endgame items that even experienced players might not possess or use in their builds. The $30 price tag is seen as too much given the skins\' limited number and nature. And while I can\'t speak to the amount of work required to complete these objectives, having over a hundred of them seems like an extraordinary amount of effort that has to be jammed into about three months, the typical duration of a league. FOMO much?</p>\r\n<p>We\'ll see if Grinding Gear Games keeps the Kirac\'s Vault pass as it is or makes some adjustments while it\'s still ongoing. In any case, we\'d expect things to be handled differently if another pass is announced for the next league -- unless people actually buy this one, despite so many arguing against it.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ir1C3L-085A" title="YouTube video player" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>',

In the case of <a href="../news/microsoft-announces-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Activision Blizzard\'s sale to Microsoft</a>, about two months.</p>\r\n<p>CNBC has learned from SEC filings that the two companies started talking about the acquisition shortly after the Wall Street Journal <a href="../news/wsj-investigation-alleges-that-kotick-knew-about-hid-sexual-harassment-activision-blizzard-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published its allegations</a> on November 16 regarding Activision CEO Bobby Kotick\'s efforts to hide harassment at his company.</p>\r\n<p>Just a few days later -- as Activision\'s stock price dropped 11% -- Head of Xbox Phil Spencer said Microsoft was "evaluating" its relationship with Activision Blizzard; two days after that, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was on the phone with Kotick to discuss a possible acquisition.</p>\r\n<p>Kotick spoke with other companies before the acquisition was announced, ostensibly in the effort to secure a better price than the one that was eventually agreed upon with Microsoft. Activision Chairman Brian Kelly also received an email from another person, unnamed in the report, who "expressed interest in a purchase of the Blizzard segment or a move to take part or all of Activision Blizzard private."</p>\r\n<p>We were mostly certain that Microsoft\'s talks to acquire Activision Blizzard kicked off some time after <a href="../news/activision-blizzard-sued-state-california-harassment-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the initial lawsuit was filed against the company in July</a>, but it\'s a little shocking to see exactly how short a time frame was involved. Spencer\'s comments -- which may have an impact on the stock price and therefore, the acquisition price -- are also curiously timed. If he\'d made them while the two companies were talking, would that have constituted a form of tampering? As it was, he officially made them just one day before negotiations got underway, which is a kind of timing that\'s almost too perfect to be believed.</p>',

			"Final Fantasy XIV Live Letter Teases Plans For Next 10 Years, Offers Some Details On Upcoming Patches",
		short_description:
			'Also, Yoshi-P says "Y\'all need to calm down" about NFTs.',

			'<p><img class="aligncenter size-large" src="../file/2022/2/final-fantasy-xiv-live-letter-709x418.jpg" alt="Final Fantasy XIV Live Letter" width="709" height="418" /></p>\r\n<p>Yesterday, Final Fantasy XIV fans got a look at what\'s to come not just in the next few updates, but with an overview for the next decade. Of course, as you\'d expect from something looking forward over ten years, it\'s a pretty broad overview. The latest Live Letter covered some of the XIV team\'s hopes, including what they\'d like to do with the game going forward in 7.0 ‚Äì something they\'re already discussing scenarios for. (For the finer details on the most immediate content, players will need to watch the 6.1 Live Letter on Friday, March 4 at 3:00 am Pacific time.)</p>\r\n<p>Before going into all that, however, the game\'s director Naoki Yoshida addressed a couple of player concerns as they were popping up in chat. The first concern, addressed during the pre-show mic test, was everyone\'s current favorite topic to be concerned about: NFTs. Not shockingly, players were asking that NFTs not be added to XIV. (That\'s a reasonable concern <a title="Square Enix NFT" href="../news/sega-rethinking-nft-plans-thanks-to-negative-player-feedback">considering the Square Enix President\'s New Years\' letter</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>The good news is that at least for now, XIV players don\'t have to worry about that. As Yoshi-P stated, "There\'s no way we\'ll be including NFTs". He noted that the decision is based on how the game is designed and added that he can state that at this time they do not have any intentions of incorporating them into the game. That being said, he did also add that NFTs might have interesting uses and noted that they could be appropriate for specific types of games.</p>\r\n<p>The whole thing was neatly summarized with, "Y\'all need to calm down." So stop worrying.</p>\r\n<p>The other, probably ongoing, worry that players voiced was that Yoshi-P might leave the team at some point. Stop worrying. According to the man, himself, the only way he\'ll consider leaving XIV is if he\'s removed by the company or the team, or if he dies. And even then he says he\'d fight it.</p>\r\n<p>So, what\'s going to happen between now and 7.0? A lot, it seems. In the first half of the stream, Yoshi-P covered the kinds of things they hope to achieve going forward and what they\'ve already got done. A big focus for the XIV team is making the game more accessible to those who may want to go it alone. He pointed out that there are many long-time Final Fantasy fans who have played all the games ‚Äì except the MMOs because they\'d really rather not have to deal with the social aspect. So, to address that, the team is currently working on implementing the Trust system from Endwalker into past expansions, beginning with A Realm Reborn.</p>\r\n<p>The Trust system will roll out to past expansions across patches 6.1 through 6.5 and will also be used as a foundation for 7.0. For the most part, they\'ll only apply to 4-player content ‚Äì scenario dungeons and four-player trials. So, you\'ll still have to party for 8-man trials or alliance raids. The first Trust conversions will take place in 6.1 and address scenarios from 2.0 A Realm Reborn. That said, three early bits of content are being changed into four-man trials in order to allow players to do them as Trusts. These are Cape Westwind and the two MSQ roulettes. It\'s also worth noting that not all early content Trusts will feature the Scions, as that just wouldn\'t make narrative sense. Instead, the Trusts will likely feature NPCs who are part of the Adventurer\'s Guild or individuals with an Echo.</p>\r\n<p>And don\'t worry. If you\'re a fan of playing with each other, matchmaking will still be there.</p>\r\n<p>Also included in the XIV team\'s plans are graphical updates. These will be done over time and include adjustments to animation and lighting while assuring it works in a multiplayer environment and trying to accommodate for a wide range of hardware. If you still play on PS4, don\'t worry, they\'re planning to continue to support that system. Some PCs might need an upgrade at some point, though. Current plans are to roll these changes out by 7.0, so you\'ll have some time. The graphics updates will focus on having higher resolution textures and better lighting for characters, addressing skin, hair, and gear. The environment will get some love too with improved lighting and ‚Äì in the case of grass, which is apparently a pet peeve of Yoshi-P\'s ‚Äì better rendering.</p>\r\n<p>Several images were shared in the video as examples. There are two things to note, here. First, all of these are the result of about a month\'s worth of work. Second, some of the images are a bit more extreme on purpose to highlight what can be done. So, if you\'re a bit freaked out by how bright the Titania looks, there is a point. Basically, look at all those details in the background that you couldn\'t see before.</p>\r\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large" src="../file/2022/2/final-fantasy-xiv-character-graphics-709x418.png" alt="Final Fantasy XIV Character Graphics" width="709" height="418" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large" src="../file/2022/2/final-fantasy-xiv-environment-graphics-1-709x418.png" alt="Final Fantasy XIV Environment Graphics 1" width="709" height="418" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large" src="../file/2022/2/final-fantasy-xiv-environment-graphics-2-709x418.jpg" alt="Final Fantasy XIV Environment Graphics 2" width="709" height="418" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large" src="../file/2022/2/final-fantasy-xiv-environment-graphics-3-709x418.jpg" alt="Final Fantasy XIV Environment Graphics 3" width="709" height="418" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large" src="../file/2022/2/final-fantasy-xiv-environment-graphics-4-709x418.jpg" alt="Final Fantasy XIV Environment Graphics 4" width="709" height="418" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large" src="../file/2022/2/final-fantasy-xiv-environment-graphics-5-709x418.jpg" alt="Final Fantasy XIV Environment Graphics 5" width="709" height="418" /></p>\r\n<p>Since it isn\'t ready yet, they didn\'t show off any gear on the stream. But, it is being worked on. According to Yoshi-P, this will be an ongoing thing and not all the graphical changes will be rolled out at once. This means some NPCs may look better than others, and so on.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, Yoshi-P discussed what we can expect in coming patches, prior to 7.0. In 6.1 through 6.5, players can expect new main scenario content, the return of everyone\'s favorite Gentleman, and a Tataru-focused storyline. All of these will receive additions over the updates. No details were offered on any of the storylines, we do know that the new Hildy quests will be titled the "Somehow Further Hildibrand Adventures" and Tataru\'s story is "Tataru\'s Grand Endeavor."</p>\r\n<p>Patch 6.1 is currently projected for April. At that point, players will gain access to the Myths of the Realm #1 Alliance Raid, Arkasodara tribe quests, the Dragonsong\'s Reprise Ultimate Duty, Ishgardian Housing, the 2.0 Trust System, and new custom deliveries featuring the Twin\'s mom, Ameliance. The update will also include the Ultima\'s Bane Unreal, but it won\'t kick off until two weeks after the patch in order to allow time for players to do other things. The new Crystalline Conflict PvP is projected for patch 6.1.5.</p>\r\n<p>In patch 6.2, players will gain access to the Island Sanctuary. This will be added to in the following patches. Also included in 6.2 will be the "Criterion" (That\'s the code name.) dungeon. This will be a 1 to 4 player dungeon and will vary in difficulty based on the number of players in the party. Pandaemonium Part 2, the Trust System for 2.x content, and Faux Hollows will also arrive at this time along with other, as yet unnamed, content. Players can also look forward to some glamour love with this update.</p>\r\n<p>Patch 6.3 includes the Trusts for Heavensward, a third deep dungeon, and a fifth ultimate duty. Patches 6.4 and 6.5 will continue with everything implemented above and finish the Trust additions with Stormblood. For those wondering about a level cap increase for Blue Mage, they\'re still hammering that out.</p>\r\n<p>On one last note, Yoshi-P also announced that changes have been made to the Final Fantasy XIV patch cycle. Rather than dropping a new patch every three and a half months, they\'ll now be dropping them every four. This is to allow an extra week each for implementation and fine-tuning. They\'re also taking into account seasonal vacations and allowing the dev team to spend quality time with their families. Yoshi-P noted that looking back he can spot areas where the quality wasn\'t always as good as it could have been if the team had been given these kinds of considerations.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s also worth noting that the amount of content they\'ve been churning out has increased over the years. It\'s something you can see well in this chart.</p>\r\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large" src="../file/2022/2/final-fantasy-xiv-development-cycle-changes-709x418.png" alt="Final Fantasy XIV Development Cycle Changes" width="709" height="418" /></p>\r\n<p>As always, we\'ve provided an embed of the stream below. Just set aside a good bit of time for it. It\'s nearly 6 hours long with the pre-show and the Q&amp;A session.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WRpdIL7_NII" title="YouTube video player" width="709" height="418" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>',

Two months ago, we learned that the studio was <a href="../news/book-of-travels-developer-lays-off-25-of-35-staff-members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laying off over half of its employees</a>, and today the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1152340/view/3138449690561066955" target="_blank" rel="noopener">informed its player base</a> that future content would be delayed while the staff focuses on polish and bug-fixing efforts.</p>\r\n<p>The "brutally honest" assessment from Might and Delight is that "Book of Travels is nowhere near the level of polish we expected it to be at this point in its life cycle, nor where we need it to be to make it a successful product in the long term." New content would only add more problems, so the focus for now is "to get Book of Travels to a place where we can start building it with brick and mortar rather than putting bandaids on it."</p>\r\n<p>The developer shared the results of a pair of polls, one that asked what the dev team should focus on first and what it should follow after that initial goal was met. The first poll resulted in 56.9% of players voting for "Gameplay bugs/glitches" and the second had 28.7% <em>also </em>voting for "Gameplay bugs/glitches," with an additional 31.3% voting for "Server Stability/Functionality." In other words, over half of all players just want the game to <em>work</em>.</p>\r\n<p>The results weren\'t surprising to Might and Delight, which will now "put everything we have into the betterment of Book of Travels," stressing that they do "have the talent onboard to straighten this out, we really believe that." I don\'t want to crush the dreams of a struggling developer too much, but if you believed you had the talent in the first place, why did the game launch in the state it did? And what was the purpose of those 25 people that were let go? It seems like some serious errors were made in high-level decision-making, and if that isn\'t sorted out, it won\'t matter what anyone believes.</p>',

Of course, that means we may still not see it until 2023, since fiscal years start in April. During the latest Ubisoft earnings call, CFO Fr√©d√©rick Duguet offered a bit of insight into the company‚Äôs current plans for the game, noting that they‚Äôre focusing on ‚Äúmultiplayer-first‚Äù with this IP, making it ‚Äúconsistent with [their] strategy to bring multiplayer competition and co-op first in a big open world, with a great, attractive fantasy‚Äù.</p>\r\n<p>This means that the original focus of a co-op game with a single-player campaign has more or less been put to the wayside. Instead, the game will feature a persistent world with all the stuff you‚Äôd expect from an open-world multiplayer game. This means quests, evolving storylines, and‚Ä¶according to <a title="Skull &amp; Bones Multiplayer Video Games Chronicle" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-says-skull-bones-is-now-a-multiplayer-first-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video Games Chronicle</a>‚Ä¶survival elements.

Tolero -- and she\'s the author of <a href="https://www.ddo.com/en/news/producers-letter-february-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today\'s producer\'s letter</a> outlining Standing Stone Games\' plans for the MMORPG in 2022. The Snowpeaks Festival is currently underway, with an additional challenge quest, titled Too Cold To Continue, which has players facing an uphill climb -- literally -- to get to the loot.</p>\r\n<p>The 16th anniversary celebration is due to kick off soon, and SSG will celebrate by making seven races and three classes permanently free for all players. At about the same time, Update 53: Hunter and Hunted, will launch, taking players into the Feywild universe and introducing a new raid.</p>\r\n<p>As for what\'s coming after that, Grow has just one word: <em>DINOSAURS</em>. This spring, the Isle of Dread expansion will introduce the terrible thunder lizards, as well as the new tabaxi player race, along with a level increase to 32.</p>\r\n<p>Grow then listed a number of bullet-pointed items, covering technical issues like better performance, bandwidth settings, and so on. In terms of content, the latter half of the year will see a new Hardcore League, an adventure pack with a "familiar villain," a touching-up of Crystal Cove, and even an update for the <a href="https://www.ddo.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ddo.com</a> website and forums. If that winds up looking as good as the <a href="https://www.lotro.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lotro.com</a> re-design, I\'m all for it.</p>',

Today, the Visionary Realms team posted the <a title="Pantheon Producer\'s Letter" href="https://www.pantheonmmo.com/newsletter/_2022/february/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monthly Producer‚Äôs Letter</a> and a lot of it focused on the HDRP makeover. So far, they‚Äôre far enough along that the build is being given the QA treatment and the designers are busy making all kinds of adjustments to Thronefast. This includes things like shifting NPCs and other items to make room for things like rocks and buildings. It‚Äôs one of those "seems mundane but is pretty important to the game" kind of things.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, the programmers are preparing the whole thing for pre-alpha testing, taking care of the stuff that makes the game world seem alive‚Ä¶plants, animals, and the like. They haven‚Äôt started on sky and lighting yet, but it is on the way. In addition, the team is working away on new weapon models, character art and animations, and more.</p>\r\n<p>On an additional note, the Producer‚Äôs Letter also adds that they‚Äôve been making adjustments to their hiring plan, which is influenced by their alpha roadmap. An updated version of the roadmap can be seen in the letter.</p>\r\n<p>And, just in case you missed it, the Pantheon Devs posted a video discussing the Giants of Terminus earlier this month. The video features Lead Artists Jared Pullen and Lead Writer JN Gerhart. In it they cover the development of the giants of Terminus, how their presence will impact players, and the lore of the giants.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6r7AVh-rbkA" title="YouTube video player" width="709" height="418" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>',

The Steel Gladiators season offers 54 levels of rewards, including the Adron cabin that was originally meant for space shuttles but was adapted for vehicular combat post-apocalypse. The season runs until April 27.</p>\r\n<p>Also added in this update is a limited-time "Arena" mode that\'s just what it sounds like: tight 3v3 PvP matches, played in a best-three-out-of-five format. There are leader boards and rankings, so you can see who\'s the best, with rewards for reaching the various tiers. This mode runs until March 20, though ranked play only runs from February 24 to March 14.</p>\r\n<p>And if you\'re looking for a brand-new way to tear a hole in your opponents, there\'s the Ripper, a new relic weapon that can only be crafted at the Secret Workbench. As the name implies, it fires circular saw blades, which the lore entry describes as "not only efficient, but also fun." Sure, it\'s all fun and games until someone loses a limb -- unless that was your intent in the first place. Then it\'s still fun.</p>\r\n<p>Learn more about the Steel Gladiators update for Crossout in the article on the website for your platform of choice: <a href="https://crossout.net/en/news/1970-update-pc-crossout-0-13-40-steel-gladiators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>, <a href="https://crossout.net/en/news/1971-update-ps4-crossout-2-68-steel-gladiators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 4</a>, or <a href="https://crossout.net/en/news/1972-update-xbox-crossout-1-0-123-steel-gladiators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox One X</a>.

Sharkmob really did mean what they said in their Valentine‚Äôs missive. (Although, they‚Äôre apparently mystified as to how everyone figured it out.) It‚Äôs not everyone that comes through on their Valentine‚Äôs Day promises, so accept the love you‚Äôre being given.</p>\r\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">\r\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Still a bit of a mystery how you all found out about it, but yes indeed, we will be running a Closed PC Playtest next month. A few details of what that means can be found in the article below. ü¶á</p>\r\n‚Äî Bloodhunt (@Bloodhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bloodhunt/status/1494686235318706186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2022</a></blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n<script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Today, the Sharkmob team <a title="Bloodhunt March PC Playtest Announcement" href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/pc-playtest-incoming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed they will, in fact, be hosting a PC Playtest in March</a> and offered up some details they feel might help prepare everyone. First off, if you‚Äôve already created a Sharkmob account and haven‚Äôt done anything to get yourself booted from the system, you‚Äôre good to participate in the playtest. While you‚Äôre in there, the dev team would like feedback, particularly in the areas of performance and visual quality. You‚Äôll have a day or two to get a feel for both, so fill out those forms.</p>\r\n<p>No, at present, there are still no set dates ‚Äì other than March ‚Äì for the event. But, the dev team promises dates and times will be revealed next week. They also say they‚Äôll include ‚Äúmore practical information‚Äù.</p>\r\n<p>Speaking of practical, today‚Äôs post also includes some technical information players will find handy. Part of the purpose of the test is to ensure they‚Äôve tackled the performance issues players had during the Early Access and that the game is now more stable on a variety of PCs. They do advise using DX12 if you can, as that‚Äôs what the game is designed for. That said, DX11 is supported if you need to use it.</p>',

Since then, the developers have been pushing ahead, <a title="Palia Alpha Testing" href="https://palia.com/palia-business-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even preparing for Alpha testing</a> ‚Äì which is close at hand. In fact, invites recently started rolling out. Those who haven‚Äôt signed up can still do so on the game‚Äôs site.</p>\r\n<p>Today, the developer decided to <a title="Palia Monetization Plans" href="https://palia.com/palia-business-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer players insight into how they plan to monetize the game</a>. You may not be too surprised to find that they‚Äôve decided to go with a free-to-play model with monetized cosmetic items. They promise no lootboxes or rotating store. The reason for the f2p model is simple. The devs want to create a world that a lot of people live in and they believe a subscription hinders that by making it inaccessible to some. To keep all things equal, the base game and all core gameplay will be free.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, players will pay for actual cosmetic content. This means clothing and costumes at the moment, but they do mention that they will evaluate things down the line and potentially add other types of cosmetics. In addition, the items in the store will be consistently available and easy to purchase ‚Äì without the need for loot boxes. They also hope to do away with players worrying about missing out on things...so far, it all sounds fairly ideal.</p>',

During this time a new ally: Bombshell Harley Quinn will be added, as will daily rewards and new custom play interfaces. The devs are also continuing to offer love to Omnimbus, currently addressing balancing scaled elite content.</p>\r\n<p>When April arrives, players can look forward to Episode 43: Dark Knights, in which the DC Universe‚Äôs heroes have failed and Perpetua is reshaping the Multiverse. Good worlds are being destroyed. The Batman Who Laughs is running amok. Things aren‚Äôt great. But, there is hope as an alliance of heroes and villains comes together to take a stand against Perpetua. That‚Äôs where the players come in. This is the end of the game‚Äôs current storyline, so expect it to be a big one.</p>\r\n<p>The new episode will include normal and elite versions of all On Duty content, open-world missions, characters from previous Dark Knights content, and more.

In this mysterious new place, players will meet The Enlightened, a race that has been in Zereth Mortis for a while now and spends all their time seeking knowledge. Players will also spend time with the automata and learn a lost language in order to discover more about the new zone. And there‚Äôs definitely something worth learning.</p>\r\n<p>One of the big features of this update is the introduction of Synthesis Forges. These forges were created by the First Ones to create the creatures that live in the Shadowlands. Now, players can learn how to use this technology for themselves and forge over fifty mounts and battle pets for their collection. As with any crafting system, this is going to require players to obtain the necessary components first. They‚Äôll also need to unlock the Synthesis Forges to know what components they‚Äôll need. As you might expect, creating mounts will be a bit more involved than creating the battle pets. They also require players to unlock a different forge than the one used for battle pets. <a title="World of Warcraft Mount And Pet Crafting" href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23763777/synthesize-a-menagerie-of-mounts-and-battle-pets-in-eternitys-end" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A full rundown on how this works</a> is available on the WoW site.</p>\r\n<p>Another big thing being added with this update is the new Sepulcher of the First Ones raid where players will pursue Zovaal and attempt to discover the Jailer‚Äôs plans. Of course, nothing ever happens in a straight line and before players reach Zovaal, they‚Äôll have to face Anduin and learn how to protect themselves from the Jailer‚Äôs magic.</p>\r\n<p>PvP players get a bit of love in this update as well with a new 6v6 brawl ‚Äì Solo Shuffle, a new Arena ‚Äì Maldraxxus Coliseum, and the kickoff of Shadowlands Season 3. Also, prepare for the return of the Darkmoon Faire in March. This year it features a new attraction, a dance competition.</p>\r\n<p>On an additional note, if you‚Äôre concerned about Sylvanas‚Äôs story going forward, you may want to check out <a title="Dextero WoW Sylvanus" href="https://www.dexerto.com/world-of-warcraft/blizzard-respond-wow-fan-concerns-over-sylvanas-story-shadowlands-9-2-1764616/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the article on Dextero</a>.

As has been the case the last two seasons, teams will compete remotely, in East (Asia-Pacific) and West (North America-Europe) divisions, with 13 and seven teams in the two divisions, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>The first and third tournaments will be regional competitions, while the second and fourth are currently intended to be live events featuring teams from both regions. The second tournament, Midseason Madness, will be a six-day affair, featuring four and eight teams from the East and West divisons, respectively, while the fourth tournament will serve as play-ins for the post-season.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Activision Blizzard is still <a href="../news/activision-blizzard-sued-state-california-harassment-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under investigation by the state of California for serious harassment charges</a>. CEO Bobby Kotick <a href="../news/wsj-investigation-alleges-that-kotick-knew-about-hid-sexual-harassment-activision-blizzard-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is alleged to have known</a> about such actions within his company ‚Äì and performed some himself ‚Äì and shielded the perpetrators from consequences.</em></p>\r\n<p><a href="../news/overwatch-2-will-used-2022-overwatch-league-season" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we knew previously</a>, this season\'s matches will use Overwatch 2 and its 5v5 PvP matches. The game isn\'t scheduled to be released to the public until sometime in 2023.</p>\r\n<p>The season\'s opening-weekend schedule was shown <a href="https://twitter.com/overwatchleague/status/1493662096856342531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitter</a>, starting off with a match between the Los Angeles Gladiators and New York Excelsior at 12 p.m. Pacific on May 5; more dates will be revealed in the near future. Given this starting date -- the <a href="https://twitter.com/owlstatsnet/status/1493665957096660993" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest ever for an Overwatch League season</a> -- and based on how previous seasons have progressed, it\'s likely that we\'ll see the end of the regular season around the first weekend of October, with playoffs possibly stretching into November.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qUJy3vSgS0" title="YouTube video player" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>',

No longer will the patch notes for major updates be buried on the forums! Hey, it only took 15 years...</p>\r\n<p>On to the actual stuff, which primarily falls under three headings. There\'s a new zone for characters level 40 to 45 to explore, the Angle of Mitheithel, "a wild land of rocky hills and deep pine-woods, and a graveyard of ancient kingdoms." Rangers prowl the area, keeping an eye out for dangers from the north. It\'s free to VIPs and available for purchase from the LotRO store.</p>\r\n<p>Erebor housing also comes with this update, with the tagline, "The Mountain may be Lonely, but with all these neighbors, you won\'t be!" Fine, I made that up, but it <em>should </em>be the tagline. There\'s also a new reward track for Legendary Items, which was described in full <a href="https://www.lotro.com/news/lotro-article-legendary-reward-track-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few days ago</a>. It\'s an account-wide track, so you won\'t need to grind it out on a per-character basis, and is the latest step in the work Standing Stone Games has done in the past to revise its Legendary Item system.</p>\r\n<p>The patch notes promise that the Hiddenhoard of Abnank√¢ra Raid is on its way soon(tm), with tiers one and two opening at noon Eastern next Tuesday, February 24, and three more tiers coming in the following weeks. The raid culminates in a final showdown between Durin and Hr√≠mil Frost-heart and is available to players who have purchased the Fate of Gundabad expansion and reached level 140.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8BnzH-L7-EI" title="YouTube video player" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>',

The game‚Äôs <a title="Broken Ranks Valentine\'s Day Party" href="https://brokenranks.com/news/valentines-day-party-event" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valentine‚Äôs Day Party event</a> kicked off yesterday and will run a full week, ending on February 21. This is to allow players who don‚Äôt spend much time in-game during the week a chance to get their party on during the far more appropriate weekend.</p>\r\n<p>To take part in the event, players will need to visit the Administrator of the Vries Estate who will require players to help organize the event before they‚Äôre allowed to take part in it. You know how it goes.</p>\r\n<p>The pre-party chores are broken into two groups: the first for levels 15-49 and the second for levels 50-140. Players in the lower level groups need to talk to the administrators at the Fishermen Village, Lesgar‚Äôs Inn, and the Bough in the Khold Forest for their assignments. Those in the second group need to talk to administrators in Khemenak, Garrison, and Beirn. Players can only participate using one character on their account, so be sure you‚Äôre on the character you want to earn event rewards on. Said rewards include upgrade flasks, psycho XP, dviggs, Emperors, and more. The event also boasts Valentine‚Äôs Day skins from prior years as well as the opportunity to obtain a love letter and roses that can be given to someone you like.</p>',

Beginning now, players can <a title="Warframe Prime Vault Program" href="https://www.warframe.com/prime-vault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchase both Primes via the Prime Vault program</a> or obtain them by unlocking them through gameplay using Void Relics.</p>\r\n<p>Banshee and Mirage are some more classic Warframes, having been introduced in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Banshee is sound-themed and uses the acoustics of the environment to determine an enemy‚Äôs weak spots and location. The Warframe can also use vibrations as attacks. Mirage uses mirror images and manipulates the light spectrum to defeat its enemies.</p>\r\n<p>As noted, both Prime Warframes will only be available for a short time before Digital Extremes locks them back away in the Vault like a classic Disney animation, so if you want them, grab them while you can.</p>',

			'<p><img class="aligncenter size-large" src="../file/2022/2/dayz-clock-709x418.jpg" alt="DayZ Clock" width="709" height="418" /></p>\r\n<p>It\'s hard to believe that it\'s been roughly a full decade since the debut of DayZ. The mod for Arma 2 was first released by Dean Hall in the spring of 2012, effectively creating the survival genre as we know it. The standalone game was launched into early access in late 2013 and fully launched five years later, and its latest <a href="https://dayz.com/article/game-update/DayZ-Update-1-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update, 1.16</a>, went live today.</p>\r\n<p>The update sees the dev team take on its "backlog of issues and set a firm foundation for our future plans." 1.16 offered them the chance to do a "clean sweep" and fix everything they could, while also adding a few bits of content. Those include the Bizon .380 submachine gun and the most critical piece of gear any survivor could ask for: a retro-styled alarm clock. Now you\'ll always know when your rice is done cooking, assuming you aren\'t just eating it raw from the bag like an animal.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://dayz.com/article/developer-update/DayZ-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last week\'s blog post</a> also laid out the plans for the coming year, which will see "frequent updates that include a healthy balance of fixes, stability, balancing, and new content." On the docket for 2022 are a ramping up of asset production, more attention paid to official terrain, more lore for Hannah, and more. In all, five updates are planned for the year, including four seasonal events, and there\'s more work being done to improve the game\'s stability across all platforms.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/STDTL4FagiU" title="YouTube video player" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>',

At least, that‚Äôs how they described it in a recent post on the game‚Äôs forums. They‚Äôve also boasted some pretty high numbers associated with the launch, such as having registered <a title="Lost Ark 4.7 million Players WCCFTech" href="https://wccftech.com/lost-ark-had-over-4-7-million-players-says-amazon-who-wants-to-be-the-most-customer-obsessed-company-in-games/?beta=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 4.7 million new players as of yesterday</a> and 1.2 million concurrent viewers spread across 112,000 streams on Twitch, with 59.9 million hours watched.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, it‚Äôs not all been good news. As we already know the game has <a title="Lost Ark Numbers" href="../news/despite-rocky-official-start-lost-ark-doing-alright">suffered congestion issues</a> resulting in them having to lock character creation on some of the servers and <a title="Lost Ark Server Transfer Founders Compensation" href="../news/smilegate-offers-lost-ark-founder-pack-owners-extra-packs-to-encourage-server-transfers">find ways to convince players to move to less crowded servers</a>. There have also been issues with items going missing from the store, players on one server losing access to the game‚Äôs main story quest, ongoing queues in Europe, and the general bugs one would likely expect after launch.</p>\r\n<p>Yesterday, the dev team <a title="Lost Ark Current Top Issues Game Forum" href="https://forums.playlostark.com/t/update-on-current-top-issues/121992" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressed these issues</a>. In the case of the store-related issues, they‚Äôve noted that there could be a few issues to deal with. As mentioned, items are missing from the product inventory. But, in addition, some players are just unable to access the store in-game, while others have found Crystalline Auras missing from their characters. That said, they do think they‚Äôre all linked and that the underlying cause is a communication issue between two servers ‚Äì the commerce server and the game server. The game‚Äôs current load is hindering their ability to communicate properly and the end results are the issues players have been reporting.</p>\r\n<p>As for the MSQ issue, this is specific to Galutar and affects around 17,000 players. The fix is going to require manual editing of each of those accounts and the players have to be online while that happens. That means it make take a while to correct the issue for everyone.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, on the EU queues, they‚Äôre working on it. That said, they note that limitations with the game‚Äôs architecture restrict the capacity in a region, so there‚Äôs only so much they can actually do about it.</p>',

The company\'s Q4 2021 earnings report is out, and it goes something like this:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="../news/ncsoft-announces-lineage-w-completion-series-worldwide-single-server-pvp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lineage W</a>: 47% of NCSoft\'s Q4 revenue</li>\r\n<li>Everything else: 53% of NCSoft\'s Q4 revenue</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>That\'s one mobile game accounting for nearly half of the company\'s revenue for the quarter. In total, mobile games accounted for 80% of NCSoft\'s take for the quarter. Admittedly, those numbers are a little aberrant in the short term, and Lineage W is available on other platforms, but even going back over the prior four quarters -- when there were no major mobile releases -- the revenue split is roughly three-to-one in favor of mobile games.</p>\r\n<p>Q4 2021 was also a down quarter for NCSoft\'s PC games, with just <a href="../review/guild-wars-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guild Wars 2</a> posting numbers better than in Q3. On a yearly basis, <a href="../review/aion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aion</a> got a boost from its classic servers, while <a href="../review/blade-and-soul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blade &amp; Soul</a>\'s <a href="../news/get-ready-blade-souls-unreal-4-upgrade-new-class-next-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-lauded UE4 update</a> did nothing to help that game\'s fortunes; in 2021, it brought in about half the revenue it did in 2019.</p>\r\n<p>Despite Lineage W\'s great showing, profits and income for the year were down, due to the development and marketing costs of the title. Don\'t worry, though -- NCSoft won\'t need to launch a Patreon any time soon to meet costs. Operating profit for the year was about $311 million, which was still down 55% from 2020, thanks to the "pandemic bump" and Lineage 2 M providing the then-"<a href="../news/q1-2020-lineage-2-m-sales-set-pace-ncsofts-best-quarter-ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best quarter ever</a>."</p>\r\n<p>Lineage W is currently only available in select territories, but NCSoft plans to expand its service worldwide, including to North America and Europe, sometime this year. If the company keeps producing hits like that or Lineage 2 M every couple of years, then those records might keep falling. Let\'s just hope the other games still get dragged along for the ride.</p>\r\n<p>You can check out NCSoft\'s financial reports <a href="https://kr.ncsoft.com/en/ir/irArchive/earningsRelease.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on its investors\' relations page</a>.</p>',

The generally standard feature of automatic demolition had been halted by the developers to prevent punishing players who were unable to access their housing because of server load back in December. Now that things have leveled out, <a title="Final Fantasy XIV Recommencing Automatic Demolition" href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/17a440595aee7afce71a0597fa448c7d455bb4d9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they‚Äôre ready to reinstate it</a>. Of course, this means that anyone who fails to visit their house within a certain period of time will be losing said housing and the gil they invested in it.</p>\r\n<p>The good news is that players will be getting some advanced warning, just as they have in the past. Just check those emails. In addition, there will be leeway for anyone who has logged into their housing since the demolition was suspended. Effectively, those who haven‚Äôt logged in at all during the demolition suspension period will have a shorter timer than those who did. In both cases, a countdown will begin on March 9th. However, those that logged in at least once during the suspension period will have a reset timer at that point. For those who did not, the timer will begin where it left off before the suspension occurred.</p>\r\n<p>What this means is that if you haven‚Äôt logged into your housing since December and don‚Äôt do so before March 9, and you had 10 days left on the timer, that‚Äôs where the timer will pick back up. However, this can be fixed by logging in anytime between now and when the demolition timer picks back up on March 9, thereby resetting it. If you‚Äôre not sure where you stand, you can check via the Timers menu. But, the best bet is just to log in before that time and avoid the issue altogether.</p>',

It\'s enlisted the help of Industrial Light and Magic -- the famed special effects company founded by George Lucas -- to create a new cinematic trailer with more story and action that you can shake a lightsaber at.</p>\r\n<p>Titled "Disorder," the trailer follows the path of a twi\'lek Jedi padawan who is separated from her brother at a young age and follows her master on a mission to destroy a mysterious machine. They\'re confronted by uber-baddie Darth Malgus, who ... well, I\'ll let you watch it, so as not to spoil the ending.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ll say this, at least: It <em>is </em>an outstanding trailer. When I saw the first zoomed-in shot of the padawan, I thought it was a real actor at first, but even without that illusion, it\'s looks fantastic and has a great story arc. It\'s almost good enough to make you forget that, after seeing a fantastic cut scene like this in game, you\'ll be tasked with multiple "Kill 10 womp rats" quests before you get to see the next one.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href="../news/game-turns-10-combat-styles-character-creation-revamps-content-coming-swtor-legacy-sith-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legacy of the Sith expansion</a> will go live later today, adding five levels to the cap and continuing the story of the the war between the Republic and the Sith, while also inserting the villainous Darth Malgus and his mysterious plans into the picture. It implements the new combat styles system and a return to the planet of Manaan, which will let you unlock a new base of operations for your faction, and a journey to Elom and the ruined Sith fortress found within. Take on that challenge alone or with party members in a flashpoint, and there\'s also an operation set aboard a deep space station.</p>\r\n<p>Learn more about the Legacy of the Sith expansion <a href="https://www.swtor.com/legacyofthesith" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the SWTOR site</a>.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QgbMAdtp7aE" title="YouTube video player" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>',

Over the weekend, I noticed a number of angry threads on the game\'s subreddit, and while I didn\'t think a follow-up article was needed, apparently ArenaNet did. <a href="https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/topic/108060-more-info-on-strike-missions-balance-and-rewards-in-end-of-dragons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Today\'s forum post</a> pointed out some of the numbers behind the changes, most significantly how many Mystic Coins players earn, on average, from high-end Fractals, which will no longer grant such awards.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m not going to dive too deep into it all, since, even as a GW2 player, I\'m a filthy casual (who still has four legendary weapons), this kind of content isn\'t the sort of thing I do regularly, and I don\'t have spreadsheets tracking my exact profit and loss from every activity. The gist of what ArenaNet is trying to get across is that you should be able to get similar, or even better, rewards for about the same or perhaps even less -- though different -- effort.</p>\r\n<p>If I can say anything salient though, it\'s the fear of the unknown that\'s fueling players\' worries, especially since it involves doing a content type that they might not be accustomed to (strikes) versus one they are (Fractals). That\'s something that will only be alleviated once players get their hands on the new content and find out what it\'s like to have to do things the new way. If that doesn\'t work as expected, you can bet that the knives will be out once again.</p>',

			'"Ruining A Literal Fairy Tale": YouTuber Close To TitanReach Reveals How It All Fell Apart',

Late last week, the indie MMO by developer Square Root Studios <a href="../news/months-after-finding-miracle-backer-indie-mmo-titanreach-once-ceasing-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that it was ceasing development</a>, only a few months <a href="../news/indie-mmo-titanreach-finds-miracle-backer-will-fully-funded-until-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after supposedly securing</a> the funds it needed to continue indefinitely. At the time, YouTuber KiraTV did an interview with both lead dev Unravel and the mystery backer who funded the game, calling the events "too good to be true."</p>\r\n<p>Kira has a new video out today that sheds a whole lot of light on the insanity that followed after that once-in-a-lifetime stroke of luck. Titled "I Have To Expose This Game Developer," he leads by explaining his relationship with Unravel -- which I\'d characterize as professional-friendly, but not overly chummy -- which led to him learning about the game\'s planned NFT/crypto turn back in November. He advised Unravel that it could work but would likely generate significantly bad PR, which turned out to be true once the plans were announced in the wake of the game\'s shuttering.</p>\r\n<p>That all falls under the genre of "confidential game development stuff" that might be considered controversial but isn\'t inherently shady or dishonest. But then Kira said it was time to "talk about how Unravel ruined his life and tried to drag me into it with him," and that\'s when it all really hits the fan.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6TkrmRxbho" title="YouTube video player" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>At that point, Kira revealed the mystery backer, Andre Cronje, described by a text blurb in the video as "a South African software developer and cryptocurrency/DeFi (decentralized finance) entrepeneur" and "one of the most influential people in the DeFi space." While that r√©sum√© might raise a few eyebrows, Kira said that Cronje has done "nothing wrong" except be "way too trusting with his finances" and that he never put any pressure on Unravel to add crypto elements to TitanReach. That was completely Unravel\'s idea, and Kira said he has copies of the conversations between Cronje and Unravel to support that assertion.</p>\r\n<p>On February 9, Unravel told Kira that he had gambled $150,000 of the money Cronje had supplied him with on cryptocurrency and "lost most of it." When he told Cronje, "he cut the funding," which was coming in monthly installments.</p>\r\n<p>Unravel sent a "proposition" to Kira that the YouTuber immediately saw as coming from "the desperation of a man who had hit the bottom." Unravel offered to raise money to help cover Kira\'s medical costs -- he revealed that he had late-stage cancer and his health is "rather poor" -- in exchange for Kira\'s vow not to contact Cronje to learn, and later divulge, the details of what had happened. "I don\'t want to be cancelled just yet," Unravel said.</p>\r\n<p>Upon speaking with Cronje, he and Kira decided that the best course of action would be to let Unravel "go quietly into the night," though Cronje would also generously clear the developer\'s debt. Unravel appeared to agree, announced the closure of the game, and that was that.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-npPyZ71nVI" title="YouTube video player" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Or at least it <em>should </em>have been. Given his previous connection to the game and its inner business workings, many people asked Kira for his take, with a few even accusing him on being in on the "rug pull." Some of TitanReach\'s other developers started messaging him as well, saying that Unravel had bought a new car and that Cronje had allegedly specifically told Unravel not to invest in crypto. Unravel had also revealed Cronje\'s identity in an employee Discord, which would eventually lead to his outing in public. Kira felt compelled to release his video because speculation was already running rampant and he wanted to present as truthful an account as he could so that none of the three players in the drama -- himself, Cronje, or Unravel -- would face undue accusations.</p>\r\n<p>As if all this wasn\'t crazy enough, another developer at Square Root Studios, named Echo, apparently impersonated Unravel on social media and convinced Cronje to give him $250,000 in cryptocurrency. Echo then "ran off" with the money, which he earmarked to pay for his father\'s surgery. He did eventually confess and gave back the money, though Cronje let him keep $50,000. Echo was understandably let go from the company, allegedly slandering Unravel on his way out the door.</p>\r\n<p>As a justification for it all, Unravel told Kira that his reasons for crypto gambling was to secure more funding in case Cronje ever pulled out. Kira said he wasn\'t sure if that was a "lie" or "half truth," but if it is Unravel\'s legitimate reason for doing what he did, it seems that even he didn\'t believe the "too good to be true" aspect of the story -- despite being at the center of it all.</p>',

Season 3: Echelon is underway, packing with it all the usual cosmetic rewards you\'d expect, as well as a new duo\'s mode for the Herald\'s Trial, so you can bring a friend with you to climb the ranks.</p>\r\n<p>Epic and legendary Souljades are getting major buffs with this update, which are outlined in detail in the video below. There\'s also a new seasonal event underway, Spring Blooms, which lets players collect Blossom Branches by completing missions and trade them in for Valentine\'s Day-themed rewards.</p>\r\n<p>If it\'s new heroes you want, one is on the horizon, as Justina Gu, Winter\'s Grace arrives on March 9.

			'<p><img class="aligncenter size-large" src="../file/2022/2/sunset-world-online-announcement-709x418.jpg" alt="Sunset World Online Announcement" width="709" height="418" /></p>\r\n<p>Some of you may (or may not) have been aware of a little 2D MMO by the name of Element Quest Online. It‚Äôs a little 2D MMO that‚Äôs been on Steam since last November ‚Äì although, it‚Äôs currently unavailable for download. That would be because the developer, Xploria/Musclebird (Now simply Musclebird), <a title="Element Quest Online Shutdown Notice Steam" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1780330/view/3138447795224031402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elected to shut the game down in late January</a> in response to several issues, mostly tied to player reception.</p>\r\n<p>Today, the company announced Sunset World Online. Also a 2D MMO, the game is intended to pick up where Element Quest Online left off, only with fewer of the issues players complained about. When the new game launches the developer hopes to offer the developers an improved experience. Some of the improvements they‚Äôve listed are a better starting experience in which players begin their journey at the ‚ÄúSchool of Magic‚Äù and a higher level cap for early access players. The cap was originally 10 and will now be 26. Also included in the list of promises are more spells and spell upgrades, more quests, more locations, and various improvements.</p>\r\n<p>The game is designed around the old-school MapleStory experience and the developer hopes for Sunset World to eventually become its successor. They feel it will bring something ‚Äúnew and refreshing‚Äù to the ‚Äúalready 3rd-person-saturated MMO‚Äù space. They also believe that being an indie studio, they will be willing to take risks and experiment with more innovative things.</p>\r\n<p>Sunset World will launch on March 1. If you‚Äôre interested in checking it out, you can find more information on the <a title="Sunset World Online Steam" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903270/Sunset_World_Online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game‚Äôs Steam page</a>. It‚Äôs probably worthwhile to pay attention to the networking notice on the Steam page, as it will give you a good idea of what you‚Äôre in for latency-wise in your region. Based on the image, it would appear all the game‚Äôs servers are currently US-based.</p>',

Five IPs in total were revealed, including Project TL, <a href="../news/lineage-eternal-becomes-project-tl-gets-shiny-new-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the former Lineage Eternal</a>, which was <a href="../news/ncsofts-mobile-division-drives-q2-decline-project-tl-aion-2-launching-next-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced as coming out sometime this year</a>, confirmed to be in the second half of 2022 in the blog post.</p>\r\n<p>The totally brand new IPs have the titles Project E, Project R, Project M, and BSS. Project E looks like a very serious game with a medieval/ancient Asian setting; Project R is a top-down brawler/MOBA; Project M utilizes motion-capture actors and looks like a modern-day crime drama; and BSS is a cute-looking, fast-moving Blade &amp; Soul spinoff.</p>\r\n<p>NCSoft\'s Principal Development Manager Choi Moon-young is quoted in the blog as saying (via Google Translate), "We plan to release a variety of video content related to the new IP starting in March," so it looks like we won\'t have too long to wait before we hear more about these new properties.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/szxrenZIsEU" title="YouTube video player" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p>',
